Algorithm for Finding Most Ordered Products

Filter Valid Orders

First, we only look at orders that are:

Not cancelled
Have completed payments


This ensures we're counting actual successful sales


Break Down Orders into Individual Products

Each order might have multiple items
We split these orders so each product is counted separately
For example, if an order has 2 shirts and 3 pants, we separate them for counting


Group and Count Products

For each product, we:

Add up total quantity sold across all orders
Count how many different orders included this product
Calculate total money made from this product
Work out average money spent per order




Get Product Details

For each top selling product, we fetch:

Basic info (title, description, price)
Related images (thumbnail and other pictures)
Category information
Other details like tags and timestamps




Sort and Limit

Sort all products by their total quantity sold (highest to lowest)
Take only the top 5 products from this sorted list
